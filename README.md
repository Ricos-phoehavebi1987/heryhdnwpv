Dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 In the Lost Lands, and honestly, what the heck was that ending? I mean, seriously, what was even going on there? It's like they just threw a bunch of random stuff together and hoped for the best. The whole time I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, I kept thinking, should I just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and go through it frame by frame or what? Insane.

So, the visuals were pretty dope, I guess, but the story was like trying to piece together a jigsaw with half the pieces chewed up by a dog. You picking up what I'm putting down? And the dialogue, man, some of it was just... out there. Like, I swear, I zoned out halfway through someone’s monologue and thought, Did I leave the stove on?

> All I’m saying is, if you’re going to throw a dragon and a talking wolf in the same scene, you better have a good reason, right? But nah, just slap 'em in there like it’s a fantasy cocktail party or something. Anything goes, I guess, as long as it looks cool.

And what's with that one character? You know the one—the guy with the weirdly shiny armor. Every time he showed up, I couldn't take him seriously. Like, wasn't he sparkling more than necessary? It’s like they had some glitter budget surplus. Anyway, when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , keep an eye out for any shiny distractions.

Here's a thought though, is it just me, or did they borrow a bit too much from literally every other fantasy   ever? I mean, at some point I was expecting Gandalf to just walk in and be like, You shall not pass, and I’d have been like, Yeah, makes sense. 

Console.WriteLine(Why is this here?);

> But hey, what do I know, right? Maybe I just wasn't in the zone. I dunno, man. It was a ride for sure. Alright, I think I need to sleep this one off. My brain's twisted in knots and I’m still not over that w𝘩𝘢𝘤𝘬 ending. Catch you later, dude.
